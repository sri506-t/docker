docker file :
------------------

FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update -y
CMD echo "hello world"
CMD echo "welcome to docker"

>
docker build . -t app1

>
docker run -it app1
>
docker run -it app1 echo 'welcome to aws'

docker run -it app hostname

------------------------------------
the CMD instruction is only utilized if there is no argument added to the run command
when starting a container.
therefore, if you add an argument to the command,you override the CMD.

==========================================
NOTE : now change docker file

#ENTRY POINT

FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
ENTRYPOINT ["echo","hello world"]
ENTRYPOINT ["echo","welcome to docker"]

>
docker build . -t app2

>
docker run -it app2
>
docker run -it app2 welcome to aws

CMD is an instruction that is best to use if you need a default command which users can easly override.
if a dockerfile has multiple CMDs, it only applies the instructions from the last one.

on the other hand, ENTRYPOINT is preffered when you want to define a container with a specipic executable.
   you cannot override an ENTRYPOINT when starting a container unless you add the --entrypoint flag



assignment :

FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
ENTRYPOINT ["echo","hello"]
CMD ["world"]

Summary :
----------
CMD Overriden

ENTRYPOINT Overriden

ENTRYPOINT and CMD appendable

CMD sets default command and/or parameters, which can be overwritten from command line when docker container runs. ENTRYPOINT command and parameters will not be overwritten from command line.
