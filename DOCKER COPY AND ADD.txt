WHAT IS A DOCKER IMAGE ?

A docker image is an executable package thaat includes everything  that the application needs to run.
this includes code, libraries,configuration files,and environment variables.

where do you find docker logs?

you can find these JSON log files in the /var/lib/docker/containers/ directory on a linux docker host.

docker networks types :

1)none
2)host
3)bridge - used within a single host
	docker network create -d bridge my-bridge-net
4)overlay - for multi-host communication
	docker network create -d overlay --subnet=192.168.10.0/24 my-overlay-net
5)macvlan - which are used to connect docker containers directly to host network interfaces.

Q)COPY and ADD are both dockerfile instructions that serve similar purpose?

-COPY takes in a src and destination . it only lets you copy in a local file or directory from your host.
(the machine building the docker image) into the docker image itself.

- ADD lets you do that too, but it also supports 2other sources.
- First, you can use a URL instead of a local file / directory.
- secondly , you can extract a tar file from the source directly into the destination.

    ADD   COPY  ENV  EXPOSE   FROM  LABEL  USER   VOLUME   WORKDIR
